Interim Submission Report: AlphaCare Insurance Solutions

1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions to accurately predict insurance claims, optimize premiums, and enhance risk assessment. The interim phase focuses on foundational steps: data acquisition, comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and setting up Data Version Control (DVC).

2. Data Overview

The dataset, `MachineLearningRating_v3.txt`, consists of approximately 1 million records and 50 features. It contains diverse information spanning policy details, customer demographics, vehicle specifications, and historical premium/claim data.

Key Data Characteristics:
Shape: (e.g., 1,000,000 rows, 50 columns)
Data Types: Mix of numerical (e.g., `TotalPremium`, `TotalClaims`, `Kilowatts`, `Cylinders`) and categorical (e.g., `Province`, `Gender`, `VehicleType`, `MaritalStatus`).
Missing Values: Identified presence of missing values in certain columns (e.g., `VehicleType`, `Gender`). Strategies for handling these will be considered in future phases.

3. Key Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA provided crucial insights into the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables, which are vital for subsequent modeling.

Premium and Claims Distributions: Analysis of TotalPremium and TotalClaims revealed skewed distributions, indicating a large number of policies with low premiums/claims and a smaller number with very high values. This suggests the need for robust statistical methods or transformations for modeling.
Categorical Variable Influence: Various categorical features like Province, VehicleType, Gender, and MaritalStatus show distinct patterns regarding average premiums and claims, highlighting their potential importance as predictive features.
Temporal Trends: Analyzing TransactionMonth showed overall trends in premiums and claims over time, which could inform seasonal adjustments or market shifts.
Creative Plots and Their Insights:

Mean Loss Ratio by Top 10 Provinces:

Insight: This plot clearly reveals significant geographical variation in the mean loss ratio across different provinces. Gauteng shows the highest mean loss ratio (approx. 0.43), followed closely by Mpumalanga (approx. 0.39), while Free State exhibits the lowest (approx. 0.11). This suggests that location is a strong indicator of claims cost relative to premium.
Value to AlphaCare: This insight is crucial for developing geographically differentiated pricing strategies and targeted risk management initiatives. It can help AlphaCare allocate resources more effectively to regions with higher loss ratios and identify areas for potential premium adjustments or product optimization.


Total Claims vs. Vehicle Age by Vehicle Type (Scatter Plot):

Insight: This scatter plot illustrates the distribution of total claim amounts across different vehicle ages, with points color-coded by VehicleType. It shows that while many claims occur for younger vehicles, higher claim amounts are not exclusive to new or old vehicles. Both Passenger Vehicle and Medium Commercial types are widely distributed across various ages and claim amounts, with some high claim outliers. The presence of 'nan' in Vehicle Type indicates missing data in this important category.
Value to AlphaCare: Understanding this distribution helps in refining underwriting rules and premium structures based on vehicle age and type. It highlights which vehicle segments might carry higher or more variable risk and also points out the need for data cleaning on the VehicleType column.

Distribution of Total Premium by Gender and Marital Status (Violin Plot):

Insight: This violin plot visualizes the distribution of total premiums, segmented by Gender and MaritalStatus. It distinctly shows that 'Not specified' and 'nan' categories for Gender and MaritalStatus account for a very wide range of premium values, including the highest outliers. In contrast, 'Male' and 'Female' genders, and 'Married'/'Single' marital statuses, generally have much narrower and lower premium distributions.
Value to AlphaCare: This demographic breakdown is invaluable for customer segmentation and personalized premium offers. Critically, it flags significant data quality issues within the Gender and MaritalStatus columns (e.g., 'Not specified', 'nan' values) which are heavily distorting the premium distributions. Addressing these missing values will be essential for building reliable models based on these demographics.

4. DVC Implementation

Data Version Control (DVC) was implemented to manage the large dataset (`MachineLearningRating_v3.txt`), which is too large for efficient tracking directly with Git.

Setup: DVC was initialized within the repository, and a local DVC cache (`data/.dvc_cache`) was configured as the default remote storage.
Data Tracking: The `MachineLearningRating_v3.txt` file was added to DVC, resulting in a small `.dvc` pointer file (`data/MachineLearningRating_v3.txt.dvc`) being tracked by Git, while the actual data resides in the DVC cache. This ensures the Git repository remains lean and performant.
Benefits: DVC provides versioning for the dataset, enabling reproducibility of experiments and efficient collaboration by separating large data files from code.

5. Challenges and Learnings

Several challenges were encountered during this interim phase, primarily related to data loading and environment setup, which provided valuable learning experiences:

File Path Resolution: Initial difficulties arose in correctly specifying the data file path, which was resolved by standardizing to an absolute path for immediate functionality. This highlighted the importance of robust path handling.
Column Name Inconsistencies (`KeyError`): Discrepancies in column names (e.g., `Kilowatts` vs. `kilowatts`, `The transaction date` vs. `TransactionMonth`) led to `KeyError` exceptions. These were resolved by carefully inspecting the DataFrame's actual column names (`df.columns.tolist()`) and correcting references throughout the EDA code. This reinforced the need for strict case sensitivity and exact naming in pandas operations.
Pandas/Seaborn Version Warnings: Encountered `FutureWarning` messages regarding `inplace=True` and `palette` usage. While not critical errors, these provided insight into upcoming changes in library APIs and best practices for future proofing code.

These challenges strengthened debugging skills and emphasized the importance of meticulous data inspection and validation at every step of the data science workflow.
